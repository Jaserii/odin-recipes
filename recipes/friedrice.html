        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 3 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is 
                tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Set 
                aside and let cool.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet 
                over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until soft and 
                translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until
                    fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in cooked jasmine rice and 
                    frozen peas-carrot mixture; fry until rice begins to 
                    brown, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter and stir 
                    to combine. Pour in eggs and cook until firm. Add oyster 
                    sauce, soy sauce, and 1/2 lemon juice; stir to combine. 
                    Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a separate pan 
                over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and fry until they are 
                bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 
                minutes. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and lemon 
                juice. Combine with fried rice mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Combine mayonnaise, water, paprika, ginger paste, white 
                sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl to make 
                the yum yum sauce. Stir well. Serve with the fried rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
